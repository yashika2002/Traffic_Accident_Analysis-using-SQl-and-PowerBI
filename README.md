# Traffic_Accident_Analysis-using-SQl-and-PowerBI
Traffic Accident Analysis using SQL and Power BI is a data-driven project that explores traffic accident patterns, causes, and severity using SQL queries for data analysis and Power BI for visualization.
Goals of this project:
✅ Identify patterns and trends in traffic accidents.
✅ Analyze peak accident hours, weather impact, and accident severity.
✅ Visualize findings through Power BI dashboards.

 1.Dataset
    File: traffic_accidents.zip (Contains traffic_accidents.xlsx)
    -The dataset includes details like date, time, location, weather, and road conditions.
    -Unzip the file to access the raw data.

2. SQL Analysis
    File: traffic_accidents.sql
    Includes SQL queries for:
    -Accident trends by year, month, and day of the week.
    -Analysis of weather and lighting conditions.
    -Identification of peak accident hours.
    -Severity and causes of accidents.

3. Power BI Dashboard
    File: traffic_accidents.pbix
    Power BI report visualizing:
    -Accidents per year, month, and hour.
    -Severity of accidents and most frequent causes.
